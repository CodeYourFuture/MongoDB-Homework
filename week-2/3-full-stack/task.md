# Making Your Node Apps Full Stack

You now know enough about MongoDB to make the Node apps that you made in the last module store the data they have in a database.

For this homework - you should add MongoDB to your Chat Server homework so that all of the data is stored in a database.

You can find the project here:
https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-chat-server

You should continue with the same project that you made before.
