# Making Your Node Apps Full Stack

You now know enough about MongoDB to make the Node apps that you made in the last module retrieve their data from a database.

For this homework you should add MongoDB to your Quote Server homework so that all of the data is retrieved from the database instead of the `quotes.js` file in the repository.

You can find the project here:
https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-quote-server

You should continue with the same project that you made before.
