# Finish in-class exercises

Before continuing with the homework you should make sure you have completed all of the exercises from our class.

The only exercise in the class was to write an API server in Express (backed by MongoDB) with routes for the following:

1. Create a film
2. Get a list of films
3. Get one film by ID
4. delete a film by ID

Optional extras:
5. Get a list of films matching a search term in the title (substring matching, case-insensitive)
6. Update a film

Optional app:
Write a react app to test your API (don't forget you'll need to install and use the cors library)
