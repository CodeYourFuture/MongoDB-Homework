# Create a diagram of the core actions in a full-stack app

Create a diagram (or diagrams) of the core actions for a full stack app, for the basic CRUD use cases we discussed in class.

Your diagram(s) should include AT LEAST numbers #1, #2 & #3. (I recommend detailing them ALL):

1. Create. User fills out and submits a form to register a new film in the system
2. Read. User requests and gets shown a list of films
3. Read. User requests and gets shown the details of one film by id
4. Read. (optional) User requests and gets list of films matching a search term
5. Update. (optional) User makes and submits changes to the details of an existing film using a form. Optional because we didn't spend long on PUT.
6. Delete. User clicks a button to delete a specific film

### You should try to capture ALL of the following:

- The order of events
- What the user sees
- What actions the user takes
- What key bits of code execute in react
- What key bits of code execute in express...
-     ... to handle the API request
-     ... to communicate with mongodb
-     ... to handle the API response
- What critical data is passed at each point

There's no one right way to do this, so be creative and find a way that works for you. I recommend you _avoid_ looking at what your classmates have done until you have chosen your OWN way.

### What tool should I use?

Use whatever tool you know best! Pen and paper is absolutely fine.
