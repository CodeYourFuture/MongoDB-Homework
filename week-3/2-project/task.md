# AirBNB Project

As discussed in class in MongoDB Module 3, we want to create a rudimentary front end for the MongoDB sample AirBnB data that we have.

The goal is to develop the following functionality:

1. Search for rooms by name or summary.
2. Filter by price.

and optionally

1. Show the top (by number of listings) superhosts in the page. On click through, show a list of their listings.

## Details

- You can use simple querying or a text index for the first question.
- You should use filtering by price for the second one.
- You can use a few ways to calculate the top superhosts in the third one. - Given that the top superhosts are not going to change that often, think about how we can use that to our advantage to make the page load faster.
