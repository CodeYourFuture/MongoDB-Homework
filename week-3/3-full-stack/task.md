# Making Your Node Apps Full Stack

You now know enough about MongoDB to make the Node apps that you made in the last module store their data somewhere.

You can find the project here:
https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-hotel-server

You should continue with the same project that you made before.
